Food Delivery Company Self-Onboarding System
This project is a system designed for a food delivery company to self-onboard restaurants. The system collects basic merchant details such as restaurant name, contact name, pincode, location, website, phone number, and average daily transactions. The system uses an API to connect the frontend and database servers. It supports SQL databases.

Why is this project useful?
This project is useful because it automates the process of onboarding new restaurants for a food delivery company. Instead of manually entering each restaurant's details into the system, restaurants can now self-onboard by submitting a form through the frontend. This saves time and resources for both the food delivery company and the restaurants.

Getting started
To get started with this project, you will need to do the following:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Install the required dependencies
3. Set up a database server (either SQL or NoSQL)
4. Update the configuration files with your database credentials
5. Run the application and start onboarding new restaurants

How to use the application?
1. Navigate to the frontend and fill out the restaurant details form.
2. Click the submit button to submit the form.
3. If the form is successfully submitted, you will see a success message. If not, you will see a failure message.
4. Check your database to ensure the new restaurant details have been added.
